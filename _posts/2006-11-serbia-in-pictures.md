Over the last week I have continued to edit and upload photos from my most recent trip to the Balkans. I already had quite a few photos of Serbia online, but my <a href="http://www.pbase.com/alangrant/serbia">Serbia</a> galleries now have many pictures of locations I hadn't visited before, and improved ones (or so I like to think) of some old favourites.
